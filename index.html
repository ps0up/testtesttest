    <section>
        <p>Paul Rand is one of the most prolific American designers to date, his work is known throughout the world to this day, due to his exceptional graphic design and success as an art director. Rand designed for United Parcel Service (UPS), Yale University, NeXT Computers, American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and International Business Machines (IBM).</p>

    <section>
        <p>Rand’s career began to take off in the 1930’s, Rand discovered a talent for changing and manipulating regular photographs into artistic compositions. These designs gave magazine pages more weight and led to him being appointed as the art director ‘Esquire’ magazine. This meant at the young age of 23, Rand was already working with one of America’s leading magazines of the time. Following this, in 1938, at the age of 24, he was featured by PM/Evening Magazine, arguably the most successful graphics trade magazine of that period. The magazine boosted Rands’ reputation, stating that Rand “is unhampered by traditions” and that “He has no stereo-typed style because every task is something new and demands its own solution. Consequently, there is nothing laboured or forced about his work.” These two statements by a such reputable magazine meant Rand had shown that he had a significant presence within the design world. </p>

        <p>In 1938 amidst the 2nd World War, Rand was asked to design covers for Marguerite Tjader Harris, the publisher of the cultural and anti-facist magazine, ‘Direction’. Rand agreed to not be paid for his work, but instead be given complete artistic freedom. Rand then created a poster (Fig. 1) which shown Czechoslovakia split by red lines representing Nazi Germany’s attack on the Czech. The image was created using a cut out of a map of Czechoslovakia which was then photographed on a white background which was illuminated in order create a shadow underneath the cut out. <img src="img/czecbdirection.jpg"> </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p> Rand commented on this work saying that it “pinpoints the distinction between abstract design without content and abstract design with content. You can be a great manipulator of form, but if the solution is not apt, it’s for the birds.“ </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Rand’s work for Direction didn’t particularly look like propaganda nor did it use the conventional tools within propaganda, like cartoons. His work favoured imagery in order to serve as both art and a political statement. Perhaps one of the most well known covers from Direction magazine was the Christmas cover in 1940 (Fig. 2). <img src="img/xmasdirection.jpg"> </p>

        <p> Rand designed a cover which featured a present across the page, however, instead of gift wrap, the present was wrapped in barbed wire. Again, much like the poster referencing Czechoslovakia, Rand photographed the barbed wire against a white background to pick up barbed wires actual shadow, giving the piece a 3D effect. The cover also had little red dots spread across it which represented the bloodshed of the War. The cover stood out as a remarkable symbol for the oppression created by the 2nd World War within America. </p>

        <h2 id="WAA">Weintraub Advertising Agency</h2> </section>
    <section>
        <p>At the age of 27 Rand became the art director for an advertising agency named Weintraub headed by William Weintraub, an Esquire-Cornonet Partner. Weintraub was one of the first Jewish advertising companies to gain a list of national clients within America, with clients such as Auto-car Corporation, Disney Hats and Emerson Radios amongst others. Within the year Rand had hired a good handful of staff, but he kept his own admission and rarely delegated work, preferring to design and handpick everything himself. This particular position for Rand gave him a much stronger influence across advertising in America. Before the 1940s advertising design was usually designed by a printer or laid out by a bullpen Boardman, Rand’s style and progression through these years clearly shown that the field of advertising design had been modernised. Rand was also responsible for influencing Bernbach who was working at Weintraub to create “creative teams”. These ‘creative teams’ were designed to join art directors and copywriters together which in effect allowed for a more refined end design to be created. Rand believed that advertising composition required intelligent solutions through design. In an essay written in 1946 Rand gave his definition of a Designers role
            <blockquote>
                <p>“The designer does not, as a rule, begin with a preconceived idea. His idea is the result of subjective and objective thought, and the design a product of the idea. In order, therefore, to achieve an honest and effective solution he necessarily passes through some sort of mental process. … Consciously or not, he analyzes, interprets, translates. … He improvises, invents new techniques and combinations. He coordinates and integrates his material so that he may restate his problem in terms of ideas, pictures, forms, and shapes. He unifies, simplifies, eliminates superfluities. He symbolizes … abstracting from his material by association and analogy. He intensifies and reinforces his symbol with appropriate accessories to achieve clarity and interest. He draws upon instinct and intuition. He considers the spectator, his feelings and predilections.” </p>
            </blockquote>

    <section>
        <p>Following this, Rand’s reputation was growing and he was no longer simply known for his brilliant designs, but for his design philosophy and way of thinking. This led to him writing his first of his four books that gave an overview of his work, designs and thought process, he taught his readers about principles which led to good design and advertisement. Rand published his book “Thoughts on Design” in 1947 through Wittenborn Books, the book illustrates and explains symbol and word, highlighting how in contrast to fine art, design has a purpose. In the preface of his book he wrote “This book attempts to arrange in some logical order certain principles governing advertising design.” </p>
        <p>Rand continued his work in art-education following a meeting with Hungarian painter and photographer Moholy-Nagy, on which Rand commented on in an interview with Steven Heller in 1988 saying
            <blockquote>
                <p> “I started reading because of a remark of Moholy-Nagy…I remember, Moholy asked me, “Do you read art criticism?” And I [Rand] said, “No.” The only thing he said was, “Pity.” </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Following this Rand became follower in art criticism and the art world, humbling himself and accepting there is always more to learn, which when learnt he would project onto his designs. Rand was a believer that practice made perfect, but he learnt you cannot practice what you do not understand. Rand built up his own library of books from different designers and different practices so that he could always refer back to the ideas and principles which he has learnt. This library was donated to Yale University in the 1990s following his death, as a way to inspire potential designers of the future.</p>

        <h2 id="RIBM">Rand and IBM</h2> </section>
    <p>Perhaps Rand’s most notable design in the world today was his complete overhaul of International Business Machines (IBM), an American multinational technology company. The newest CEO of IBM at the time, Thomas J. Watson Jr, thought of a new mandate for the company ‘Good design is good business’ which showed a new evolution in the company’s image operations. Eliot Noves, the curator of industrial design at the Museum for Modern Art in New York, was asked by Watson Jr. to assemble a group of designers to help create new look for IBM. Rand developed the logo’s design with the companies atheistic in mind, he used eight striped bars to show a monogram of the IBM logo he’d created (Fig. 3). He wanted to ensure the logo could be used on all applications such as magazine ads, trucks, packaging etc. Rand brought an elaborate booklet to Watson Jr. showing his design being used in many different ways, showing his designs functionality, flexibility and effectiveness and stretching the imagination of his clients. The IBM logo which Rand created has been an intricate part of the company’s image to this day. The current creative director for IBM, Henry Yoo, when asked if he would consider changing the logo simply stated “You don’t throw away something that special very easily.”</p> <img src=img/ibmlogo8bar.png>

        <h2 id="CONC">Conclusion</h2> </section>
    <p>In conclusion, Paul Rand is one of the most exciting and inspiring designers to date and a true master of his field. He taught and analysed the world of design in order to create books which would lay the guidelines for successful design and advertisement, hoping to help future designers to be original, innovative and creative. His profound effect on the world of design and advertising is still recognised effortlessly throughout the world, two decades after his death. Rand separated himself from other designers due to his care for a function and need in design, rather than simply an atheistically pleasing end design. Rand’s view transformed the world of design and opened up more possibilities for upcoming designers, he welcomed modern art and abstract ideas within design to serve as solutions to problems. Moholy-Nagy described Rand as a “painter, lecturer, industrial designer, and advertising artist who draws his knowledge and creativeness from the resources of this country.” But, perhaps better suited, Yusaku Kamekura said “the word that probably fits Paul Rand best is genius.” </p>
